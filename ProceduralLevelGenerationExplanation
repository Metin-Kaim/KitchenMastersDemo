In this system, the rules for each difficulty level are defined before the game starts using a Scriptable Object structure.
When the game begins, a random difficulty level is selected, and the level is created based on the rules of that difficulty.

These rules include the grid size, the spawn chances of different game pieces (such as blocks, candies, or special items), and the empty spaces between them.
Because of these rules, each difficulty level has its own structure, pace, and level of challenge.

During the level generation process, the grid is filled step by step according to these rules.
However, instead of placing everything completely randomly, the system uses some balance checks.
For example, to make sure the player does not get stuck at the start, some predefined playable patterns are placed inside the grid.
This helps the player start the game with possible moves and a playable setup.

As a result, the system creates a new and unique level every time, but always keeps the gameplay fair and consistent.
This method increases replayability and removes the need for manual level design.
